# Tic-Tac-Toe (Player vs AI)

This is a Python implementation of a Player vs AI Tic-Tac-Toe game. The AI utilizes the **Minimax Algorithm** to determine its best move. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where the player and AI take turns placing their mark (X or O). The game ends when a player has three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when all squares are filled (tie).

## Features
- Player vs AI (Player uses 'O' and AI uses 'X')
- AI makes intelligent moves using the Minimax algorithm
- Automatic detection of win, loss, or tie
- Simple console-based interface
- Dynamic board display

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `minimax_algorithm.py` (Ensure the minimax function is properly implemented and available)
